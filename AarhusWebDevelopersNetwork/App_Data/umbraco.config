        <metaDescription><![CDATA[Developers are prioritising Android over iOS]]></metaDescription>
        <articleItemContent><![CDATA[<p>Android's growth has been phenomenal, and the OS now powers approximately 84 percent of global smartphones. With such a huge market share it's just one reason behind a monumental shift towards developers prioritising Android over iOS.</p>
<p>In the latest 'State of the Developer Nation' report, Vision Mobile highlights a significant prioritisation of Android development over iOS across most of the major regions, particularly in the East. In the West, professional development for both platforms is split equally but there's a wide margin between those who are developing for Android as a 'hobby' or 'side project' compared to iOS.</p>
<p><span>"We entered 2016 with Android marginally ahead: 40% of professional developers globally prioritised the platform versus 39% for iOS. That seems to have been a tipping point, with our latest survey showing a large shift from iOS to Android. A massive 47% of mobile developers now tell us they consider Android most important, while preference for iOS has slipped to 31%," said Mark Wilcox, Business Analyst at Vision Mobile.</span></p>
<p><span>Part of the reason for this shift could be the growing complexity of iOS development; which used to be easier than Android due to less fragmented hardware and more robust APIs. Whilst the Android platform has matured and become easier to develop for – particularly in UI scaling – iOS has become more complex due to an introduction of split-screen features and new devices. </span></p>
<p>"Historically, iOS had a few fixed resolutions and higher quality APIs for UI development. Android had a vast array of screen resolutions and aspect ratios, and fairly basic abstractions for dealing with that complexity. However, with the launch of the iPhone 6 and 6 plus in 2014, along with split-screen mode for iPads in 2015, Apple has forced iOS developers down a scalable UI path as well. Once the UI of an app has to adapt to multiple resolutions dynamically, the complexity isn’t significantly increased by having to work with many more resolutions," explains Wilcox.</p>
<p>Another place where Google has trumped Apple for many developers is with app design. Whereas both Apple and Google now use a flat and minimalist design, many developers prefer the extensive 'Material Design' guidelines which Google provides rather than Apple's relaxed approach. This is causing developers to build for Android first and then adapt their app for iOS; whereas previously the opposite was often the case.</p>]]></articleItemContent>

        <metaDescription><![CDATA[Pressure to rapidly launch apps is causing security problems]]></metaDescription>
        <articleItemContent><![CDATA[<p>In a world that's growing ever more reliant on apps, the rapid pace at which they're being developed and deployed is causing significant problems with security, according to a new report. </p>
<p>The report, <a href="https://f5.com/Portals/1/PDF/security/f5-ponemon-report-2016.pdf">Application Security in the Changing Risk Landscape</a>, was undertaken by the Ponemon Institute and F5 Networks to highlight the security risk to users from apps that were "rushed to release." </p>
<p>In the poll of 605 IT security professionals, most (35%) responded that mobile apps posed a "significant" risk increase to their organisation's security. 25 percent thought mobile apps increased the risk to some extent, and 30 percent indicated no risk increase. Nine percent said that mobile apps reduced the security risk to some extent; whilst just one percent said they "significantly" decreased the risk. </p>
<p>When it comes to cloud-based apps there was some disparity; with the highest percentage in a single category of the IT professionals (36%) responding they posed no risk increase. Most were still concerned, however, with 26 percent and 25 percent responding a significant or minor security risk increase respectively. </p>
<p>"More than half of all survey respondents believe that cloud-based applications increase risk, while 63% of all survey respondents believe that attacks at the application layer are harder to detect—and more difficult to contain—than those at the network layer," wrote Mike Convertino, Chief Information Security Officer at F5 Networks, in a <a href="https://f5.com/about-us/blog/articles/application-security-in-the-changing-risk-landscape-the-ponemon-report-21615">blog post</a>. </p>
<p>Approximately 31 percent of business apps are mobile now, and in the next year, that's expected to increase to 38 percent. Meanwhile, 37 percent of software is cloud-based, with that percentage expected to grow to 46 percent. Along with the increased growth, comes increased risk. </p>]]></articleItemContent>

        <metaDescription><![CDATA[Google and Microsoft beefing up HTML5 bet for browsers]]></metaDescription>
        <articleItemContent><![CDATA[<p>Some might say it has been a long time coming – but recent pronouncements from Google and Microsoft have shown a clear indication towards bolstering HTML5 on their browser experiences.</p>
<p>Writing on the <a href="https://chrome.googleblog.com/2016/08/flash-and-chrome.html">official Chrome blog</a> earlier this month, Google announced that version 53 of its Chrome browser will automatically block certain elements of Flash – such as loading behind the scenes for analytics – in favour of HTML5. The move represents a step up from June last year where some Flash content became click-to-play.</p>
<p>“Flash helped make the Web a rich, dynamic experience, and shaped the modern set of web standards,” wrote Anthony LaForge, Chrome curator of Flash in a blog post. “We continue to work closely with Adobe to ensure that your web experience is as fast and secure as possible and to help the Web transition to HTML5.”</p>
<p>Elsewhere, industry commentators have noticed how a recent Windows 10 build had improved the HTML5 capabilities of its Microsoft Edge browser. <a href="http://www.ghacks.net/2016/08/14/microsoft-edge-improves-on-windows-10-14901/">According to gHacks</a>, the new features in Edge has pushed it up to 500 out of 555 points in terms of HTML5 compatibility through the HTML5Test product. In comparison, Google Chrome Canary scores 504 while the current stable version of Edge scores 466.</p>
<p>So where does this leave us? Writing for this publication back in January, app development house Mubaloo argued that while HTML5 was more than ready to replace Flash in terms of web development, it was more complicated for apps.</p>
<p>“HTML5 is the future of websites, as it is the language that is best suited for the changing landscape, to support smartphones, tablets and desktops,” the company wrote. “It is also the language that is the best base for creating web apps that can run on desktop or mobile devices. This suits apps that are lighter, in terms of functionality, or require less access to hardware or OS level services, than apps that work best natively.</p>]]></articleItemContent>

        <articleItemContent><![CDATA[<p>Despite <a rel="noreferrer nofollow" href="http://www.developer-tech.com/news/2016/aug/11/windows-10-developer-calls-out-microsofts-strategy/" target="_blank">the disdain</a> from high-profile developers surrounding their strategy, Microsoft continues to improve the development experience on their platform with the launch of an open-source UWP toolkit and new functionality to enable Windows 10 apps to send notifications to specific users.</p>
<h2>UWP Community Toolkit</h2>
<p>Starting with the open-source UWP Community Toolkit, Microsoft announced the project's launch on its official developer blog earlier today. The kit will enable a simplified UWP app development process across the many supported devices – PC, Mobile, IoT, HoloLens, and now Xbox.</p>
<p>The UWP toolkit features new helper functions, custom controls and app services that simplify or demonstrate common developer tasks. Microsoft says, where possible, their goal is to allow app developers to get started with just one line of code.</p>
<p>One provided example demonstrates how the UWP toolkit handles all the OAuth authentication steps behind-the-scenes when enabling content sharing from your app: </p>
<p>// Initialize service</p>
<p><em>TwitterService.Instance.Initialize("ConsumerKey", "ConsumerSecret", "CallbackUri");</em></p>
<p>// Login to Twitter</p>
<p>await<em> TwitterService.Instance.LoginAsync();</em></p>
<p>// Post a tweet</p>
<p><em>await TwitterService.Instance.TweetStatusAsync("Hello UWP!");</em></p>
<p>Similarly, UI elements can be animated with a single line of code:</p>
<p><em>await element.Rotate(30f).Fade(0.5).Offset(5f).StartAsync(); </em></p>]]></articleItemContent>

        <metaDescription><![CDATA[Ubuntu now supports React Native – speeding up iOS and Android ports]]></metaDescription>
        <articleItemContent><![CDATA[<p>Ubuntu, one of the biggest names in Linux distributions, has announced support for the React Native framework. With application development using web technologies becoming ever more popular, today's announcement will be welcome news for many developers. </p>
<p>"The web apps team at Canonical is always focused on ensuring the right frameworks are available to developers. The Cordova <a href="http://cordova.apache.org/">framework</a> is one such framework that is very well supported with a set of Ubuntu specific APIs and has gained a lot of attention and traction with developers," the Ubuntu team wrote in a blog post. </p>
<p>A major benefit for developers familiar with React Native is the ability to port their existing Android or iOS applications to Ubuntu. For those which are ported from mobile or tablet, Canonical says the applications will "react" and dynamically scale complete with touch-friendly and pointer window controls. This convergence is made possible due to Ubuntu's support for a full range of displays, interfaces, and inputs. </p>
<p>React Native is based on the web-friendly ReactJS declarative programming model and its strong UI component system, but the framework provides an additional layer of system performance using native UI components and platform APIs to deliver a deeply integrated user experience. </p>
<p>"The development tools are fully supportive of snaps and incorporate an easy basis to create a snap and publish it to any Snappy Store, therefore giving the app much greater relevance across devices built for mobile, desktop, IoT etc," says Ubuntu in their post. </p>]]></articleItemContent>

        <projectItemBodyText><![CDATA[<p><span>There are many users who purchase products through E-commerce websites. Through online shopping many E-commerce enterprises were unable to know whether the customers are satisfied by the services provided by the firm. This boosts us to develop a system where various customers give reviews about the product and online shopping services, which in turn help the E-commerce enterprises and manufacturers to get customer opinion to improve service and merchandise through mining customer reviews. An algorithm could be used to track and manage customer reviews, through mining topics and sentiment orientation from online customer reviews. In this system user will view various products and can purchase products online. Customer gives review about the merchandise and online shopping services. Certain keywords mentioned in the customer review will be mined and will be matched with the keywords which are already exist in the database based on the comparison, system will rate the product and services provided by the enterprise. This system will use text mining algorithm in order to mine keywords. The System takes review of various users, based on the review, system will specify whether the products and services provided by the E-commerce enterprise is good, bad, or worst.

        <projectItemBodyText><![CDATA[<p><span>Steganography is the technique of hiding private or sensitive information within something that appears to be nothing be a usual image. Steganography involves hiding Text so it appears that to be a normal image or other file. If a person views that object which has hidden information inside, he or she will have no idea that there is any secret information. What steganography essentially does is exploit human perception, human senses are not trained to look for files that have information inside of them. What this system does is, it lets user to send text as secrete message inside an image file, user uploads the image and enters the text to send secretly, and gives a key or a pass word to lock the text, what this key does is it encrypts the text, so that even if it is hacked by hacker he will not be able to read the text. You will need the key to decrypt the hidden text. User then sends the image and key to the receiver and receiver first opens the image, and then he enters the key or password for decryption of text, he then press decrypt key to get secret text of the sender. By using this method you can double ensure that your secret message is sent secretly without outside interference of hackers or crackers. If sender sends this image in public others will not know what is it, and it will be received by receiver.</span></p>]]></projectItemBodyText>

        <projectItemBodyText><![CDATA[<p><span>Encryption is commonly used for encryption of text as well as images. Various encryption algorithms exist for this purpose. Here we propose to build a secured image encryption algorithm that can be used to encrypt as well as send images remotely to the intended receiver. Our system can link to remote client to our software installed on remote system and connect to it for image transfer. Our system uses RSA algorithm for this purpose. User may submit his image for encryption. Our system now gets the image and converts it into hex format before being encrypted. Then we use RSA algorithm to encrypt the image for sending through the internet. User may now select the intended user from among the list of users having our software installed. Our system now send the image in an encrypted format through an active internet connection. Even if an attacker gets the file he first has to Decrypt it using proper keys which are not available to him. He then needs to decode the image into proper image format. When image reaches intended receiver he must first enter required keys. On entering the right keys the software decrypts the entire image in original format and provides it to the receiver. Thus we encrypt and securely send images over the internet using secure RSA encryption.</span></p>]]></projectItemBodyText>

Well for a study and integration of two major technologies together we propose a client server based communication application made by integrating JAVA with dotnet technology. Here we propose a dedicated client server based architecture that allows for chat as well as authoritative commands by the server over client application. We integrate the two technology and have a working communication between these two technologies. We here propose to build the server application using JAVA and the client side application using Dotnet(C#) technology. Our system consists of the server as an authorities admin and client as a client application in Dotnet. The server has the right to start chat, enable disable client application as well as record the client pc screen as and when needed. Thus we integrate two major technologies in a live internet based client server application for robust live internet based communication.</td>

The rating score is used as evidence, based on the ratings of various users system will predict whether the information provided on the web can be trusted or not. This system uses user ratings to infer trust relationships between users. The rating score of the user is used as evidence to find out whether the information displayed on the web is trustable or not. Mining web user trust relationship is important in web information credibility analysis. Motivated by the imprecise nature of trustiness, we propose a novel web user trust prediction method based on evidence theory, which uses user ratings to infer trust relationships between users, where each rating score is treated as evidence.
